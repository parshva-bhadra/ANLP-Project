            "The answer to this question will be subjective as there are a large number of contributing factors to the democratisation of England. England was relatively more urbanised than other nations and also had a number of liberal thinkers throughout its history, both of which contributed to a more democratic philosophy. The crown had also been weakened progressively over many centuries, particularly by the Glorious Revolution and the Hundred Years Way. Furthermore, the religious reality of the country may have played a significant part in how democracy evolved."

                "text": "There are not many situations of annexation or unification in recent history, and most of those are accompanied by warfare or guerrilla violence.So this is a relatively unusual situation.Given the narrow question you asked, the most obvious answer is German unification .The DDR/GDR basically just dissolved and those East German Lander were incorporated into the BRD/FRG under the Basic Law.It didn't take troops invading, so I don't know if you mean it.It was also certainly popular on both sides (at least in the sense of favoring Einheit).One could also pose the United Arab Republic as an answer, though maybe not one you were looking for.Syria offered to join Egypt in a fit of pro-Nasser pan-Arabism, but also to ward off perceived Communist influence over their government.The hybrid state of two noncontiguous portions only lasted three and a half years until Syria seceded.Nasser talked about pan-Arabism, but didn't make any moves to bully or to woo Syria.The parallel to Crimea is not terribly strong, but it was an annexation (Syria wanted full union, not a federal union) and it did not come from or cause violence.There are examples of territories annexed to the United States with varying degrees of violence or pacificism, such as the gift of the Northwest Territory by the British (an unexpected windfall), the Louisiana Purchase, Texas Annexation, Oregon Territory from Britain, Mexican Cession & Gadsden Purchase, purchase of Alaska from Imperial Russia, controversial annexation of Hawaii, and so on.I'm not sure the extent to which you'd consider a purchase of territory to fit your criteria, but many of them were done more or less peacefully, except to the extent that the locals suffered violence from the new government.The Mexican Cession came from war, but the Texas Annexation was itself peaceful - excluding the war for independence that Texas had just waged (with a number of border-crossing Americans pushing for the fight).You could also have examples of territories returned to former sovereigns who lost it from warfare, negotiation, or colonial tribute.This would include the return of Hong Kong from the UK and Macau from Portugal to China, the return of borderland territories from Russia to China, the return of the Sinai to Egypt by Israel, and so forth.I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but there are more of these examples.These were all peaceful, but often the previous disposition had been either via warfare or through colonial threats.There are some other Russian examples mildly parallel to the Crimea.Russia had troops in South Ossetia as observers since 2004 and issued Russian passports to many South Ossetians and Abkhazians during the 2000s.In 2008, this was cited as a basis for Russian troops moving into Abkhazia and strenghtening their position in South Ossetia, though neither has yet been annexed and of course there was a relatively brief period of warfare.The main comparison is that it was a matter of Russia slicing off territory from its neighbors.Russia did something similar with Transnistria, a breakaway portion of Moldova that has Russian troops and a leadership with an essentially Soviet-era outlook.But Russia has not made real moves to annex Transnistria, which is both landlocked and noncontiguous with Russia, so would be an exclave.It is also not ethnically Russian.You can find other examples where annexation led to non-state violence (terrorism or civil war) like Israel and Jerusalem or Morocco and Western Sahara.One could get into little nitpicking fights about Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights and whether to count its annexation (including Shebaa Farms, claimed by Lebanon) as resulting in violence or as subsumed in the larger regional conflict.None of these annexations have been accepted by an international consensus of states, as with Crimea."

I am considering taking out one or two of these to knock out some of my higher interest loans, which can be between 7% - 9.5%. Is this a good idea? Are there any drawbacks?",

You need to work out if this is worth it as the interest on a student loan is tax deductible whereas the interest on the loan from your credit union is probably not.

Rolling it to your next company's 401(k), unless the current one is a good one.Or you could roll it to a traditional IRA, and that would later allow you to \"convert to Roth\".Roths are better than Traditional for non-math reasons ( and for math reasons if tactically done in a \"gap year\").However, they also have Roth 401Ks .And money in an IRA is not as well protected as 401(k) money .401(k) money is immune to outside attack - it cannot be lost in bankruptcy (say, a medical bankruptcy), and cannot be taken by lien or lawsuit, and that is decided at the Federal level.IRAs may or may not have that protection; that's decided by individual states.Move, and you could lose protection.Roth 401(k)s are a thing ...but only if your plan offers that."

                "text": "Perhaps I missed something in the other answers.The one and only reason is because of SPLASHING.Rain over the gutter, a hard sideways rain will splash mud/soil onto the siding.Not good for siding as the mud tends to hold moisture too long and can cause rot as well as a dirty 'skirt' on your siding.The gravel, drain rock, cobble or even the lava rock as pictured in the first picture however needs to be below the sidingat least 4\" otherwise the rock becomes a moisture problem.That first picture with the lava rock and the trap?That lava rock is touching the siding.The siding appears to be concrete.Concrete foundations need to be coated with asphalt for protection.Concrete is very much harmed by moisture.The picture with the 4X6 holding in cobble?If that rock is as close as I think it is to the siding, that will rot the siding if it is not at least 4\" below the siding.Before the cobble or gravel gets installed this is when landscape fabric is necessary.Not to prevent weeds but to prevent the cobble sinking down into the soil and the soil replacing the cobble.The following is off topic but hopefully helpful...I wish I could find a more common mulch people could use instead of chunky bark.This is not for weed suppression it is to unify a landscape by covering the soil with a regular texture.Chunky doesn't work.Fine works far better for aesthetics and for decomposition sometime in the near future.The only mulch I will ever use in the landscape is human poo mixed with sawdust and completely decomposed professionally. Grins.That 4\"X6\" (not pressure treated)? is a great condominium for insects and other animals; slugs, snails, earwigs, pillbugs...and many more.Not at all necessary or even beneficial.I lived and breathed construction in all forms for half a century.The only reasonand it works well, for using cobble at the base of an outside wall, is for splash.If this is your lawn here is the best way to fix those edges.Also look up how to produce and maintain a cool season lawn crop!On our site, not on Scott's or Ortho...Use a hose or string, a center to make a set radius to change when changing point of radius to the outside of the lawn.Keep radius curves consistent for each curve.They can change radii every curve but not during each curve.lawn edging the right way"

Sometimes, even these inflated ranks are subject to inflation, with A being about average and the real goal being a more different S rank: SS or even SSS.Urban Dictionary's S-Rank article (linked article is SFW, but the site itself can have some very NSFW content) also lacks a concrete origin: Something that is so superlative that it cannot be described by any traditional ranking system.It is A++, 11/10, six stars, and three thumbs up.In rare cases, something can be so exemplary that it becomes SS or even SSS-rank.Many people have wondered what the S stands for.Special?Super?Schwarzenegger?No one knows for sure.Comes from Japanese video games, like the Devil May Cry series, where A-rank just wasn't good enough.In addition, all 3 of these sites are editable by anyone on in the Internet, so I'm not sure that any of these can be considered concretely reliable, and the assertion on the Giant Bomb article that it's related to the Japanese grading system has no source and isn't one I can confirm because I am not familiar with the system.Basically, as the TVTropes article stated, it's just a way for there to be a ranking that is better than the \"best\", similar to how some games have Platinum medals on top of Gold."

CritDamage : Percentage of damage-increase due to a critical hit Using a ruby will add RubyDamage *AttackSpeed* (1 + CritChance*CritDamage) to your total expected DPS, while using an emerald will add WeaponDamage *AttackSpeed * (CritChance)(EmeraldCritDamage) to it.You only want to use a Ruby if the first expression is larger than the second expression; that is, (first expression)>(second expression)RubyDamage*AttackSpeed*(1+ CritChance*CritDamage) > WeaponDamage*AttackSpeed*(CritChance)(EmeraldCritDamage)RubyDamage*(1+ CritChance*CritDamage)/(CritChance*EmeraldCritDamage)>WeaponDamageThus you only want to imbue a ruby if the expression RubyDamage*(1+ CritChance*CritDamage)/(CritChance*EmeraldCritDamage)is greater than your weapon damage+bonuses.Note that this damage will increase as your primary stat goes up, so in general the emerald is the better choice for the long-run.Noticealso this equation does not depend on your attack speed at all .[Edit]To make this easier to make sense of, I've created a graph: How to read this graph:First, find your critical-hit damage% and critical-hit chance% (as shown on your detail tab in-game) .Find that value on the above chart, and get its approximate value.Next, take your damage (as shown on your character sheet) and divide by your attacks per second (as shown in the \"details\" tab) .If your damage (divided by attack rate) is larger than the graph-number, use an Emerald.But if the damage is smaller than the graph-number, use a Ruby.If they are approximately the same, you could use either, but I would recommend an Emerald, since it will scale better as your damage goes up.The above chart is for Flawless Square gems.The other gems are largely similar: ChippedFlawed Normal Flawless Perfect Radiant Square Flawless Square Perfect Square Radiant Square Star Flawless Star Perfect Star Radiant StarSo, in general, if you have low damage and low crit-chance, use a ruby; if you have high damage or high crit-chance, use an emerald (though if you have high crit-chance but low damage, you might want to double-check here ) ."

Shut down her mobility LeBlanc thrives on getting her combo out without the opponent having time to shoot back since she is quite squishy.After she used her combo she can't do anything for several seconds, so if you manage to stun her before she gets out with her W (if i remember correctly, root/snare works, too, but i might be wrong there)you can return a lot of damage...that is if your own champion is tanky enough to survive the initial burst.Note that LeBlanc silences, so you need to get your stun out very fast."

            "The main reason this happens is for efficiency and flexibility. It helps to use small planes to have shorter boarding times and more frequent flights for short trips that usually have less passengers, while for longer flights it helps to concentrate passengers in a bigger plane, since longer boarding times and less frequent flights are to be expected in these types of trips. What is more, the airlines do not profit from keeping their planes idle so they schedule their flights accordingly. Another factor is that the bigger a jet-engine is, the more efficient it is and bigger planes have more fuel capacity, thus they can cover longer distances."

There is simply more room for fuel in a larger aircraft.Smaller aircraft may have options to carry additional fuel talks to increase range.Note that this trend also applies to business jets despite their market having less of a correlation between range and passenger demand.In addition to the geometrical constraints, airlines have other reasons for not operating large planes on short routes , or vice versa, more often.Using small planes allows for more frequent service and more flexibility even if there is enough demand to use a smaller number of larger aircraft."

That said, the lamination of a conductive screen on surfaces could protect wooden aircraft. Another solution is to use an appropriate type of conductive paint. However, it can be argued that it is not that useful to take such precautions, because wooden planes are not able to stay close to Cb clouds for long enough to be endangered by lightning strikes.

Jet fuel is by far more efficient. The cost would be too high as well, and the results not that impressive.

Lemmon, Jr., reported in May 1945 in his report on possible jet fuels (from history.nasa.gov ): \"Although the liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen system has by far the highest specific impulse performance of any system considered in this report, the low average density of the fuel components almost completely eliminates this system from all but very minor applications.\""

I'll take the Trek 7.1FX for my example.The chainrings in front are 48-38-28t.In the back it's 14-16-18-20-22-24-34r.(Numbers are the number of teeth).I don't know if it's typical on other hybrids, but that jump from 24 to 34 is a little unusual and they market it as a special \"megarange\" feature.If you work out all the ratios (I wrote a sort of little computer program up real quick to do it), the only exact duplicate ratios this gear setup has is 28:14 and 48:24, one of which is one of those extreme ranges it's suggested to avoid.So this bike actually has 20 unique gear ratios, but since one of those unique ranges is 48:34 that you should avoid, it's 19 usable unique gear ratios.If you round to only one digit after the decimal to give you the nearly identical ratios, you get 15 gears: 0.8 28:341.1 28:24 or 38:341.2 28:221.4 28:20 or 48:341.5 28:18 or 38:241.7 28:16 or 38:221.938:202.0 28:14 or 48:242.1 38:18 or 48:222.3 38:162.4 48:202.6 48:182.7 38:143.0 48:163.4 48:14But look carefully at what front chainrings you use to get those...If you use the smallest front chainring with only the 3 biggest rear cogs, the middle front chainring with all but the biggest and smallest rear, and the big front chainring with only the four smallest rear cogs, you get your whole range of gears in a way you can comprehend, but it's 12 really usable gears (you skip 1.4, 2.0 and 2.7 in my above chart; all close enough to another gear) How many rear cogs it makes sense to use on each front chainring will depend on the exact gearing setup.But if you play around with it a little you can probably just feel it.Switch the front chainring to the middle, switch the back to the smallest and feel that gear; then switch the front to the biggest, switch the back in by 2 or 3 gears and see if it feels about the same.Do the same thing with the low-end."

Step 3 Degrease the derailleur using Finish Line Speed Clean, a powerful degreaser that dries almost instantly.You won’t have to wait before applying lube, or worry that the lube will be broken down by excess degreaser that didn’t dry.This is also a good time to go over the pulleys again.First spray down the jockey pulley with Speed Clean while turning the crank, then take your rag, hold it between your thumb and forefinger, and pinch the pulley while continuing to turn the crank.Any dirt that didn’t come off on the screwdriver blade will come off on the rag.Repeat with the bottom pulley.This is most effective if the pulley is still moist with degreaser when you run it through the rag.Because Speed Clean dries so quickly, ensure this by spraying down only one pulley at a time, so that the bottom pulley doesn’t dry before you’re done with the jockey.Step 4 Lubricate the derailleur by first spraying it down with Finish Line Dry Teflon Lube, then injecting Extreme Fluoro, a fully fluorinated grease, into all points of friction."

Have a reciprocating shaft running down the steering tube, operating a crank on the front wheel, and driven by a crank axle above.This is the inverse of your standard windmill water pump where the reciprocating shaft from the windmill drives a water pump below.The other option is electric drive.In fact, most electric-assist bikes already have, in effect,2-wheel drive.One could add a generator to the back wheel to supply power to the front (in place of a battery), similar to the electric drive of submarines, diesel locomotives, and large military trucks."

The blood becomes thicker, but not enough cyclists have died from this to make conclusive statements. People living at higher altitudes often have a lower life expectancy, but this could be due more to social factors.

Posture - riders who might remember the Moon Landings might be expecting to sit up quite straight (ie Dutch-style bikes) where the back is almost vertical.To do that on a modern hybrid bike needs a low saddle, which encourages the knees apart.Fear of falling - Saddles can be set down by riders who want to put their whole foot flat on the road while stopped.Yes this is a saddle-too-low, but the root cause is poor balance, or a perception of the same.Beer gut - I was over 100 kilos when started riding seriously on a road bike, and to use the drops I had to be standing out of the saddle, else the belly and the upper thighs tried to occupy the same space.Even a minor tum will affect the upper thigh and where the skin folds to the lower tummy (technical term anyone?)Thunder Thighs - related to the stomach one above, but simply lower.If the rider's thighs are a bit thick, then repeated rubbing on the sides of the saddle's nose may be an irritant and drive their thighs apart.Chaffing is no fun.An unfortunate choice of clothing?I've done rides where something wasn't sitting quite right, and to alleviate irritationhave sat up or rearranged things like seams.This would be a more temporary situation.Moisture - poor clothing choices can build up sweat in all sorts of places.Dampness could also come from rain or from road water and poor mudguards/fenders leading to damp clothes.History - riders who have come from a MTB or BMX background may be subconsciously prepared to stick a foot out and dab.That's where they do a light touch on the ground to help with balance on a corner.Speed - Sitting up and spreading yourself out catches more air to slow you down.If you're going too fast then this is one way to reduce speed.Again, more subconscious than planned.Have I missed any?Balance- I know I've used my knees like a motorcyclist on a turn, to vary my \"lean\" quicker.Probably not pedalling at this moment though."

Modern bikes are better at providing the right amount of flex without using triangulation in many places, and the support at the down tube and top tube is sufficient for strength requirements. Bicycles are not normally meant to be as stiff as possible. Modern mountain bikes have suspension that allows a lot of movement, and the rake of a fork on most bikes is there to allow some flex."

                "text": "orthodox: adherence to accepted norms Is playing Bach like Glenn Gould orthodox or not?Some will swear by what he does with Bach and probably say yes, while others will cry out loud \"Nooooooo\"!I think answering your question about using the pedal with Bach faces the same dilemma: since Bach isn't there to tell you what he would like to have heard when transcribing his harpsichord or organ pieces to the piano, it is a matter of interpretation deemed to change somewhat with the culture and your own sensibility.More importantly, what is deemed as an acceptable interpretation will vary with the piece, the instrument it was composed for, and what people have gotten to accept over time.A few examples: Prelude 1: Many will play it with the pedal on, only changing it every couple of measures.Since all notes within that measure build on one simple harmony, it does not change the main intent of the piece.It doesn't muddy things out too much or prevent you from hearing a second or third voice that isn't there to start with.So you can say using the pedal two measures at a time for that piece is orthodox as in \"accepted by a large part of the community today\"A fugue: Silences are as important as the notes themselves to define the melody in this form and using the pedal for too long will generally extend notes or link some voices together in a way that Bach clearly did not want.Press the pedal to help yourself linking one voice and disregard the complexity of the other voices and you will likely create an interpretation that doesn't respect the intent of the composer and isn't deemed orthodox.Use it parsimoniously to make some transitions clearer in one of the voices without muddying the rest and preserving the symmetry between the voices, and people will likely consider that you are making a good use of the piano to enhance the original work of Bach, making your interpretation \"orthodox\" by most standards.To finish, I will take one of my favorite piece of Bach at the present time: a transcription or a prelude by Siloti interpreted by Gillels here .That piece is conventionally played twice, once letting the right hand lead the melody, the second time letting the chords resonate.It is absolutely delicious and both versions are completely different, something that wasn't Bach's original intent, that is only possible on a piano, and that is yet widely accepted today as \"the\" right (orthodox) interpretation of that piece.So there you have it: I believe using the pedal for Bach can definitely be considered orthodox but there is a context to it."

The author shows a descending scale (the caratted numerals above some of the chords)so perhaps that may help.I think he's using the Roman numerals associated with E-Major but the score is written as e-minor; he's assuming that all chords have sevenths (OK, but limiting).Then we have (if the score were in e-minor):VII7, VII7, VII7, VI7, III, VII7, VI7, V7, IM7 (at least as I would notate it.)"

                "text": "Ice cream is essentially a foam of ice crystals surrounded by sugar syrup, and air.The amount of air--called overrun--introduced during the churning and freezing process controls how dense, heavy and \"creamy\" the ice cream is.The more air ice cream has, the easier it is to scoop, since there is less solid mass being cut through.Ice cream with less overrun will be harder to scoop but have a smoother, heavier mouth feel.Hagen Dazs is an example of a supermarket ice cream with low overrun.Ice cream with more overrun--Breyer's is an example of a supermarket brand with the maximum legal 100% overrun--will have a lighter, fluffier mouth feel.The second factor is temperature.Sugar syrup does not freeze at 32 degrees.As ice cream freezes, water crystals crystalize out of the syrup phase, making the syrup even more concentrated, and further lowering its freezing point.The colder the ice cream is stored, the harder it will be simply because there will be more ice and less liquid syrup.Good commercial ice cream shops will store ice cream in the back freezer at -10 F, but warm it to 25 F in the counter freezers for service.Lastly, if the scooping instrument is hot (for example, dipping the ice cream scoop in hot water), it will melt a bit as it cuts through.Sharper scoops are also more effective.So your options for easier to scoop ice cream are:Serve it warmer, such as by \"thawing\" a bit in the refrigerator before serving.Buy or make ice cream with more overrun.Use a hot, sharp scoop.A bonus one--ice creams without hard chunks mixed in are usually easier to scoop.Vodka or other ingredients in the mix will change the the freezing chemistry, but not radically--they are more for flavor (some flavorants dissolve in alcholol but not water, or because of the flavor in the liqueur itself)."

                "text": "The usual texture is crisp outside crust (which usually collapses and cracks a bit - this is a blowsy dessert, not a neat one - even if it breaks in half as you move it to a plate, just shove the bits together again and carry on) and a stable cooked foam interior, which gives some tooth resistance.Cream on top to cover defects, sharp fruit to dress.Passionfruit pulp is a good base, it's quite sour but with a good flavour.Reasonsa pavlova comes out soft or weeps - remembering that most of them weep a little depending on the humidity - Overbeaten whites.You should beat using a stand mixer on about 75% of max speed for a maximum of 8-10 minutes or you risk the foam structure collapsing and the pavlova weeping.Start adding sugar at firm peak stage about 1 min 30s, about one dining tablespoon per 20s or so, aiming to have it all in by 6-8 minutes.This is because the foam forms too many bonds between the protein strands, these tighten and squeeze out both air and water molecules, leaving too much free water in the mix.Undissolved sugar.Use caster/fine granulated sugar, aim to have it all in by 8 mins beating.By 10 mins beating it should be dissolved so that you can't feel grains if you rub a bit of mix between your fingers.Undercooked foam, unlikely if instructions have been followed. Overcooking.Unlikely if instructions have been followed and oven temperature is accurate.Humidity - this is the big one.If the outside crust of the pavlova isn't crisp, humidity is the likely culprit.If this happens, you can put it in a small room and run a dehumidifier, which helps a bit.Leaving uncovered in refrigerator for several hours can also help as long as anything else that might evaporate is covered.Basically if it's humid, cook something else.Also - more minor - don't add water to the recipe, this is asking for trouble if humid.Don't forget the acid source - usually 1 tsp white vinegar or sharp citrus juice per 4 whites, this helps break sulphur bonds in the egg proteinso the foam can form.Making a pavlova is simple really, and a few technique tips are all you need.To some extent the recipe itself doesn't matter much, it's the technique that makes or breaks it.So what you do is: Ideally use egg whites at least a couple of weeks old, they foam to a larger volume.Avoid fat, so use a clean metal bowl and beaters, no plastic, no yolk contamination.Oven preheated (my own personal failing) Set timer to ten minutes.Start beating at about 75-80% of max speed on a stand mixer.You can use a handheld, but I don't know the times for that.Start adding sugar at firmish peak stage, about one and a half mins.I use a table dessert spoon or tablespoon and add a rounded spoonful every 15-20s or so, flowing it in around the close edge of the bowl to avoid too much weight in one place.Add acid after a couple of spoonfuls of sugar.Finish sugar by 8 mins beating.Continue to beat until sugar is dissolved - test by rubbing between fingers.If you have to beat longer than 10 mins you risk collapse and a bit of weeping.Fold in cornflour (stabilises it) and vanilla or other liquid flavouring if using. Pile onto baking paper on tray in a rough circle about 4\" high and roughly smooth the top.Cook as directed.This should involve turning off the oven at end of cooking and leaving in a closed oven until cool.When cold, shift to a flat serving plate.The easiest way to do this is to lift the baking paper with pavlova still on it onto the plate.Roll one edge of the paper under (towards the plate) and gradually peel back from underneath the dessert base.This reads long, I know, but the process is in fact quick and easy.

Use more oil than you think you need.A 1-2 mm layer will get in between the cracks of the scallop and allow for better heat transfer.Use a oil with a high smoke point, not olive oil.Grape seed oil works great and is neutral.Corn oil is cheaper, so is canola.Make sure theyre dry when they go in.Pat them on paper towels, then season.Don't use frozen scallops, buy dry scallops.frozen scallops give up juice when they hit the hot pan.Plus they are usually soaked in a solution to make them heavier.You can tell if they were frozen because they're be sitting in a pool of milky liquid and will likely bewhite/milk colored.Dry scallops are pink, light orange or cream colored.If you use butter, add it when you flip.Otherwise the water cools the pan too early.You can baste the scallop with a spoon, but keep the butter frothing by turning up the heat.Don't mess with it, sear it.Let it sit.Flip once.Keep them apart otherwisethey steam."

                "text": "Contrary to what several folks have said, garlic is not crushed primarily to help peel the skin.For example, garlic can be peeled easily with the clove intact, by cutting the small hard circular bottom of the clove (the part that's attached to the base, opposite to the pointy end).This will help loosen the skin, which should then come off very easily or will separate if you gently slide the blade of your knife in and loosen it.While it certainly is true that crushing helps separate the skin, making it easier to peel (perhaps some folks might do it for that reason at home), that isn't the reason why professional cooks do it or the reason why recipes suggest it.Why crush garlic?Garlic is primarily crushed to release its oils, which in turn infuses subtly different flavours to the dish than if you didn't crush.Joe's comment above explains the chemical reaction: ...within the garlic cells are alliin and alliinase, which when combined, form allicin, which is the 'strong' flavor ...You might also find this article from the Washington Post, where the author talks about the art of cooking with crushed garlic in Italian restaurants, a really good read.Specifically, the author addresses some of these key points which are very relevant here.1.Crushed vs. MincedFrom basic physics, something that is broken up into several tiny bits has a much larger total surface area than the whole intact piece.Since the oils extrude from the cut surface, it stands to reason that minced garlic will release them sooner and readily, often leading to a more pungent taste than desired.In addition, minced garlic can be quite temperamental and you might often end up over cooking/burning.As the author notes: In its customary minced or chopped form, garlic can impart a pungent flavor that is difficult to harness.Add it too early to a sauté or stew and garlic burns and becomes acrid.Add it in the latter stages of cooking and the garlic steams or boils, leaving it raw-tasting and unpleasant.On the other hand, slightly crushed garlic is more versatile and heat tolerant.Left whole and partially smashed (just enough to release its powerful oils), garlic adapts to a range of high-heat techniques, cooking steadily and lending a mellow richness to a dish.2.Usage in dishes Crushed garlic is pretty standard in several Italian dishes.The advantage of having one or two large crushed pieces (in addition to those mentioned above) is that you can easily remove them from the dish once you're satisfied with the aroma/taste of the dish.This can be extremely annoying to do with minced garlic.Some of the dishes that are enhanced by using crushed garlic are: In [roasts, stews, quick meals and stir-fries], smashed garlic cloves are remarkably flexible, absorbing high heat and in turn giving off subtle but substantial flavor.What happens when you crush?To answer why crushing garlic works, let me quote a bit from a good answer to the very popular question on chopping onions (since we all understand onions better):The enzymes and amino acids involved in producing the Onion Lachrymatory Factor (seriously!) are normally contained in the cells, and only become a problem when released in volume.Using a sharper knife will avoid mangling cell walls, creating more clean separations between layers, and reducing the amount of enzymes released.Garlic, along with onions, shallots and leeks belong to the group of plants (genus) called Allium and being very closely related, the above is more or less true.Indeed, it makes sense that if you want large volumes of oils/enzymes, you'd do exactly the opposite of the above advice, which is to crush it and break all the cell walls!This also aids in the mixing of the chemicals per Joe's comment above.Note that although a large volume is \"released\" or ready to be released due to the crushed cell walls, they make their way to the dish slowly because of the smaller surface area."

                "text": "Since people's capabilities vary enormously, I'm going to answer in terms of AMS - altitude sickness.Although susceptibility to AMS also varies, there are some general rules of thumb for how much a person \"should\" climb in a given day which are worth knowing.For starters, at up to about 3000 meters, you don't have to worry about it too much.What I mean by this is that theoretically, you could ascend from 0 to 3000 in a day and not be at excessive risk.An example of this would be hiking to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and back up - 1700 meters each way - which, if you're in great shape, is possible without risking AMS (but crazy for all the regular physical reasons).At higher altitudes you pretty much have to go gradually to let your body acclimate.If you're planning a trek to the Everest Base Camp (5380 meters) in Nepal, a rate of 300 meters per day is generally suggested.Less than that means that though you might be fine for a while, eventually the change will catch up to you and then you'll need to stop until you're better.I know that some people climb Mount Whitney (4421 meters, in the US) in a single day, but I wouldn't recommend it - at 4000 meters changing altitude rapidly is very likely to make you sick.They manage to do it because they both ascend to the summit and descend in a single day (AMS symptoms usually begin after a few hours delay) and therefore are back at lower altitudes before the symptoms kick in.I'll close with some personal experiences.On the way to the Everest Base Camp, I decided to \"skip\" a day and walk to segments back to back- 600 meters change, at around 4200 metersaltitude-and I became sick that evening, although my companion was fine.In a later trek (a few years later) my companions and I averaged about 500 meters/day to a maximum altitude of 4000, and all of us were fine.Like many other things in the \"Great Outdoors\", it's best to plan conservatively until you feel comfortable with the subject and have more experience."

CGI show off .Don't forget it's an early 90s movie.CGI was super expensive, super awesome, super... cool.Magic.People watched Star Trek TNG and Black or White only because of the CGI back then.Which, at that time, were not just \"OK effects\" but stuff nobody could even have imagined as being possible before.You see the same thing (villain face) in \"Matrix\" where every agent is Mr. Smith (and the few that arent, at the few, selected occasions, are all Mr. Jones and Mr. Brown).Why do civilians who are taken over by agents need to look like Mr. Smith?Well because Neo getting beaten up by the cat lady, or by a stinking hobo in the subway tunnel isn't nearly as \"chic\".The hobo doesn't have the face of the villain.In-universe, the T-1000 is a nigh-invincible war robot, but as we see in the movie, it's not bulletproof, nor indestructible.So, avoiding being shot upon first sight is certainly not against mission parameters.Plus, it has the concrete assignment of killing one particular person.What's the single best approach to do that?Well... get near the person in the form of a normal, harmless human, and then... just kill her.Oh wait, it was the boy who was to be killed in that movie...never mind, all the same.Kill him .Pulling off a \"I am Megatron, Destroyer of Worlds, bow to me or die!\" in the middle of L.A. neither helps avoiding trouble with local authorities, it also significantly reduces the likelihood of civilians being willing to help you find your mark, let alone your mark who knows about murderous robots from the future , staying where he is.Really, there exist better strategies for not alarming everybody and their mother than appearing as an obviously non-human killer robot."
